# odin-recipes
My very first project in Html as part of the Odin Project curriculum.

We have to build a website offering different recipes (3) that the user can chose from the homepage (index).

Each recipe consist of a title, picture of said recipe, followed by a description, the ingredients, the steps to make it.

I added 2 additionnals "features" to the recipe pages, a table representing the prep/cooking/total time and a table with the nutrition facts.
